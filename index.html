	<meta name="description" content="Hi, my name is Kenneth Zhang and welcome to my personal website. I am originally from Diamond Bar, California. However, I currently live in Los Angeles to attend school at USC. I am currently a junior majoring in Economics, but I am also trying to get a minor in Data Science. As an economics major my goal was always to one day pursue a career in finance, however over the past year I have realized that I want to pursue a career in brand licensing instead. I am interested in brand management because I want to be able to focus on solving complicated and creative problems. So if you have any openings or job offers like that, I would love to hear them! Thank you!">

			<p>My name is Kenneth Zhang and I am originally from Diamond Bar, California and I currently live in Los Angeles to attend school at USC. I am currently a junior majoring in Economics and I hope to one day do brand marketing or brand strategy for a major technology company or entertainment firm. I have taken a variety of classes during my time at USC and learned a lot of skills. For instance I learned how to program in Python, SQL, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. In addition to that, I also took a variety of entertainment courses including Art and Industry of Theatrical Film and Managing Television Studios Internet Media. I hope to one day be able to utilize these skills as a brand strategist or marketing leader. In this past summer I worked as a licensing intern at Seltzer Licensing Group, and I got to work with a wide variety of clients inclduing NBC, Airheads, and Breyers Ice Cream. In my free time I like to listen to music or going backpacking!</p>
